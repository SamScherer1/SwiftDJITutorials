> Note: The binding procedure is only necessary for applications used in **China**. For this reason only an [Objective C version](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/ios-tutorials/ActivationAndBinding.html) of this tutorial exists. See [Integrate SDK into Application Tutorial](../application-development-workflow/workflow-integrate.md#register-application) for instructions on application activation and the final product [here](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK-Tutorials/iOS-ImportAndActivateSDKInXcode-Swift).

You can download the tutorial's final sample project from this [Github Page](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK-Tutorials/iOS-ImportAndActivateSDKInXcode-Swift).

See [this Github Page](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK-Tutorials/iOS-ActivationAndBindingDemo) for an Objective C version that also covers aircraft binding.
